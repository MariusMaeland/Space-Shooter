One of the requirements was that all moving objects in the game should sub-class
pygames sprite module. The pygame Sprite module is designed to make simple game 
design easier for developers. It includes built in functions for referring to 
and working with coordinates, displaying images for a better graphical look as
well as detecting collisions and working with objects/sprites in groups. 

Sprite groups is practical because it makes the use of polymorphism very easy.
The sprite module has a built in draw function which blits each sprites "image" 
attribute on a surface. We have also used this to simplify per frame update calls
on many different objects.

Allthough not a specific requirement, we have implemented and thoroughly enjoyed 
making animations with sprite sheets. Linking the actual code and the image 
files has given us valuable insight into how code interacts with "the outside world".
Cutting specific sections of a sprite sheet proved difficult at times, as each sheet
had a different layout, size, padding, alpha channels etc.
